# üß© RAIMEE: Relational AI Model Explorer and Editor

**RAIMEE** is an **interactive visual interface** for exploring, editing, and refining hypotheses induced via **Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)**.  
It provides a **no-code environment** for domain experts to interact with relational machine learning models ‚Äî combining visual analytics with logical reasoning.

> üß† *RAIMEE extends ideas from AIMEE (‚ÄúAI Model Explorer and Editor‚Äù) into the relational domain, integrating logic-based reasoning from ACUITY with intuitive, human-centered visual interaction.*

## üìö Overview

RAIMEE enables users to iteratively train and refine **logic-based machine learning models** through an intuitive visual dashboard.  
Users can induce rule-based hypotheses, inspect them through multiple relational visualizations, and refine them by providing **interactive feedback** via visual mechanisms ‚Äî no Prolog expertise required.

## üß† System Architecture

RAIMEE integrates three key layers:

1. **Frontend (Dash + Python):**
   - Built with [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
   - Interactive visualizations, user feedback mechanisms, and layout components
   - Subdirectories:
     - `assets/` ‚Äì static files (CSS, JS, icons)
     - `components/` ‚Äì Dash components for visualization and feedback
     - `layouts/` ‚Äì pre-defined Dash layouts and static interface artefacts

2. **Backend (Prolog + Python):**
   - Logical reasoning and hypothesis induction via ILP
   - Prolog modules for background knowledge, rule induction, and constraint handling

3. **Data Layer:**
   - `data/` directory contains example relational datasets, including:
     - **Mutagenesis dataset**
     - **Michalski‚Äôs Train Problem**
   - Users can also import their own relational data (SQL or linked CSVs)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

~~~bash
python src/app.py
~~~

Once launched, open your browser at:
```http://127.0.0.1:8050/```


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can modify host/port in `src/app.py` if needed. Requires everything in `requirements.txt` and **Python ‚â• 3.9** (and a Prolog environment such as SWI-Prolog if your setup invokes Prolog directly).


## üåê Interface Overview

RAIMEE provides a no-code, interactive workflow for inductive logic programming over **relational** datasets:

- **Dataset Overview** ‚Äî Inspect relational data via schema diagrams, linked tables, and graph views.
- **Hypothesis Induction** ‚Äî Induce an initial rule-set (hypothesis) from background knowledge and class labels.
- **Hypothesis Inspection** ‚Äî View rules in logical or natural language; assess rule coverage/support visually.
- **Model Editing** ‚Äî Provide feedback with integrity constraints, define/edit rules, and assert new (counter)examples.
- **Model Comparison** ‚Äî Compare versions of induced rule-sets to see how feedback shaped hypotheses.

This reflects the interactive loop described in the paper: data ‚Üí initial hypothesis ‚Üí user feedback ‚Üí refined hypotheses.


## üßÆ System Workflow (Diagram)

System Overview: Relational data is ingested and encoded as logical facts within a knowledge base (the Background Knowledge). The ILP model uses this knowledge, along with separate files that define the
class labels of each sample, to induce an initial rule-set (hypothesis). This hypothesis is subsequently presented to the user for inspection. The user can then iteratively feed back to the model via specialised ILP mechanisms to guide it towards a more desirable hypothesis.

## üñºÔ∏è Expected Output (Screenshots)

When the app is running, you should see views like:

- Dataset overview (schema/table/graph)
- Rule induction & rule coverage
- Model editor (constraints, examples, rule edits)
- Model comparison

## üìÇ Example Datasets

| Dataset               | Description                                      | Location                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Mutagenesis           | Classical ILP benchmark for mutagenicity         | `src/data/mutagenesis/` |

## üß© Technical Notes

- Front-end: **Dash + Python** (visualizations, components, layouts).
- Back-end: **Prolog** for ILP-style logical reasoning; Python wrappers to orchestrate induction and constraints.
- Data ingestion: relational inputs (SQL or linked CSVs with PK/FK); translated to logical facts in a background knowledge base.
- Interactive mechanisms:
  - **Integrity constraints** to include/exclude literals in future hypotheses.
  - **Rule editing/definition** via UI, translated to logic constraints.
  - **Assert examples** (positive/negative) to rebut/shape hypotheses.
- Visualization: Plotly for charts; graph views for relational structure and rule coverage.
- Run locally with `python src/app.py` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`).
